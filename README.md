I have tried reading the data based on the paper and column names were given according to same.

Either download the small file(i have worked on small file) and exract it to put in iot folder.
Code is designed for windows because dataset is distributed into multiples files and folders so change the directories accordingly.

you will need Python 3.8 and Pandas for reading the file
Matplotlib for creating Knowlwdge graph its a playaround file, use any columns as per your choice to build the graph.
